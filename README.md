# work_from_home_automation
Now you can sleep all day and yor laptop will be own whole day!!
I have done it by using Pycharm which is an python code editor.
In the first I have written **pip install pyautogui** and entered it in the terminal.
Then at the first of the code I have imported pyautogui.
Then I have imported time.
Then I have written pyautogui.FAILSAFE = False.
then I have written while True and inside this i have written time.sleep(300) then I have created a for loop called for i in range(0, 100): and inside this for loop I have written pyautogui.moveTo(0, i * 5) this is for moving the cursor then I have created another for loop called for i in range(0, 3): and inside this for loop I have written pyautogui.press('shift') this is for to press the shift button as the shift button does not do anything.
Now your home automation bot is ready now you can sleep all day without any tension!!
